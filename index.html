        <h1>Who am I?</h1>

          <p>
            Hi, I'm Sebastian. I am a student at Holy Cross High School in Hamilton, Scotland (UK). I was born in Poland but moved to Scotland with my family at the age of 4.<br>
              I'm not the most outgoing person you'll ever meet - I don't usually enjoy talking to new people in real life, but I can get along with others when needed.<br>
              I'd say im pretty honest. I teld to withhold a lot of personal information, probably because I've got some trust issues - though I'm only just starting to realise that. I often overthink how others will react, so I just stay quiet. <br>
              Creativity doesn't come naturally to me, probably because I've always been more used to following directions than expressing ideas freely. But I'm someone who genuinely enjoys learning how things work - both in the digital world and the real one.
           </p>
